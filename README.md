# val loader for webpack

## Usage

``` javascript
var a = require("val!./file.js");
// => execute file.js while compiling and 
//    take the result as javascript code for including
```

Don't forget to polyfill `require` if you want to use it in node.
See `webpack` documentation.

The execution of file.js has polyfill already applied.

This loader is also useful if you want to provide data for another loader:

``` javascript
require("css!val!./generateCss.js");
```
